        <h3>What is Carbonara?</h3>
        <p>Carbonara is an Italian pasta dish from Rome made with eggs, hard cheese, cured pork and black pepper. The dish arrived at its modern form, with its current name, in the middle of the 20th century. The cheese is usually Pecorino Romano, Parmigiano-Reggiano, or a combination of the two.</p>
        <h3>Where is Carbonara originated from?</h3>
        <p>Everyone loves Carbonara. Always considered one of the traditional dishes of Roman cuisine, its origins, however, are Neapolitan. Its birth is recently, about 1944 when an American soldier came in Italy.</p>

        <h3>How to make Carbonara Step-By-Step</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Bring a large pot</strong> of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Drain, toss spaghetti with 1 tablespoon olive oil, and set aside.</li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Place diced bacon</strong> in a large skillet over medium heat; cook and stir until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain bacon on paper towels, reserving 2 tablespoons bacon fat in the skillet.</li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Add 1 tablespoon</strong> olive oil to bacon fat in the skillet. Add chopped onion and cook over medium heat until onion is translucent. Add minced garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add wine and cook 1 minute more.</li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Return cooked bacon</strong> to the skillet; add cooked spaghetti. Toss to coat and heat through, adding more olive oil if it seems dry or sticks together. Add beaten eggs and cook, tossing constantly with tongs or a large fork, until eggs are barely set. Quickly add 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese and toss again. Season with salt and pepper (remember that bacon and Parmesan are very salty).</li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Serve warm</strong> with chopped parsley sprinkled on top and extra Parmesan cheese at the table.</li>
